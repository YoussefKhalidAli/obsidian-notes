AWS App Runner is a fully managed service used to **deploy and run web applications and APIs without managing infrastructure or containers directly**.

**Explanation:** It abstracts away servers, containers, scaling, and load balancing so you can deploy applications directly from source code or a container image with minimal configuration.

---

## 1. Core Concept

- Deploy web apps or APIs from:
    - Source code (Git repositories)
    - Container images (e.g., from ECR)
- Fully managed by AWS

**Explanation:** You don’t manage EC2 instances, clusters, or Kubernetes. AWS handles everything behind the scenes.

---

## 2. How It Works

1. Provide application source code or container image
2. Configure basic settings (CPU, memory, scaling, health checks)
3. App Runner builds (if needed) and deploys the application
4. AWS automatically exposes it via a public URL

**Explanation:** The service takes care of build, deployment, infrastructure provisioning, and networking.

---

## 3. Infrastructure Abstraction

- No EC2 instances to manage
- No ECS/EKS configuration required
- No load balancer setup needed

**Explanation:** App Runner completely hides the underlying infrastructure layer.

---

## 4. Scaling and Availability

- Automatic scaling based on traffic
- Built-in load balancing
- Highly available by default

**Explanation:** It automatically adjusts capacity based on incoming requests without user intervention.

## 5. Networking and VPC Access

- Applications are exposed via a public HTTPS endpoint
- Can connect to VPC resources such as:
    - Databases (RDS)
    - Caches (ElastiCache)
    - Queues (SQS)

**Explanation:** While the service is fully managed, it can still integrate with private AWS infrastructure when needed.

---

## 6. Configuration Options

You can define:

- CPU and memory allocation
- Auto scaling behavior
- Health checks
- Environment variables

**Explanation:** Configuration is intentionally minimal compared to ECS or EKS.

## 7. Use Cases

- Simple web applications
- REST APIs
- Microservices
- Fast deployment of production-ready applications
- Developers who do not want to manage infrastructure

---

## 8. Key Points

- Fully managed application hosting service
- Works with source code or container images
- No infrastructure management required
- Automatic scaling and load balancing included
- Simplest AWS service for running containerized web apps
- Can connect to VPC resources when needed
